        "description": "This API provides locations of City of Surrey traffic loops and the corresponding traffic loop counts in 15 minute intervals. While the counts are broken up by 15 minute intervals, the data is currently loaded only once per day.  We are hoping to increase this frequency to at least once every hour. The LOOP_ID field is common to both datasets and can be used to cross-reference them.",
